bit is a zero or one and a byte is 8 bits

b = bit
B = byte
Storage is measured in bytes and networking is measured in bits

binary counting, base 2 counting
each place moving from right to left signifies a power of 2

0000 4 bit


exponents, binary math, memorize all the powers of 2, up to 32

# Rule One: When you multiply two exponents with the same base, add the exponents.
# Rule Two: When you divide two exponents with the same base, subtract the exponents.
# Rule Three: When you have an exponent expression which is raised to a power, multiply the exponent and the power together.
# Rule Four: Anything to the power zero is “1”.
